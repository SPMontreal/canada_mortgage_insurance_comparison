This calculator compares the cost over the life of a fixed-rate mortgage loan either (a) with or (b) without CMHC (or equivalent) mortgage insurance. Usually, when you are paying 20% or more of the purchase price as a down payment, it will be financially advantageous to take an uninsured mortgage. The difference in rates does not make up for the extra cost of mortgage insurance. However, consider the following scenario:

1) you were pre-approved for an insured mortgage loan;
2) you're in the process of purchasing a house where you can afford to put 20% or more down; and
3) mortgage rates have increased since your pre-approval.

How big does the gap have to be between the lower insured rate and higher uninsured rate to make the insured loan, with optional insurance, worth taking?

Determining the difference in cost between an insured and uninsured mortgage is not as simple as tallying up the cost over the initial term. In the following term, the starting balances will not be identical, so interest costs will differ. In addition, purchasing mortgage insurance lowers your interest rate not only for the initial term, but potentially for subsequent terms as well (although once your loan-to-value gets low enough they may converge).

This script calculates the total cost over the mortgage loan with and without mortgage insurance, based on a few simplifying assumptions:

1) no additional pre-payments are made;
2) the mortgage insurance is added to the principal (as is usually done); and
3) interest rates do not vary after the beginning of the second term, only differing based on whether or not the loan is insured and what the loan-to-value is.

The third assumption obviously isn't realistic, but while variation in future rates will drastically affect the overall cost of the loan, it should have a relatively small effect on the relative costs of an insured versus uninsured loan.

To estimate future interest rates for insured and uninsured mortgages, and at various loan-to-value ratios, you can look at any mortgage provider's website. For example, looking at Nesto's mortgage rates today (https://www.nesto.ca/mortgage-rates/):

insured: 5.14%
uninsured, 75-80% LTV: 5.34%
uninsured, 70-75% LTV: 5.34%
uninsured, 65-70% LTV: 5.29%
uninsured, 0-65% LTV: 5.14%

If I'd like to base my calculation on the estimate that, from the second term to the end of the loan, the average mortgage rate will be about 1% lower than it is now, I would punch the following values into the calculator:

insured: 4.14%
uninsured, 75-80% LTV: 4.34%
uninsured, 70-75% LTV: 4.34%
uninsured, 65-70% LTV: 4.29%
uninsured, 0-65% LTV: 4.14%

The calculator includes the cost of sales tax on mortgage insurance in the provinces where this applies. This cost is paid immediately and is not added to the principal.
